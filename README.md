Hello! Im Germán, a computer engineer from Spain! ❤💛❤ 

Im currently learning about game development. 🎮🕹🖥 

I'm interested on both runtime and tool programming.
I don't have a favourite game engine, but I usually work with Unreal Engine and Unity.

You can check some of my work on my [portfolio](https://www.germanalfonsoteixido.com).
